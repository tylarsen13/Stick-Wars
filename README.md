How to Play: To move a unit, click on it.  Available moves for that unit will then become highlighted.  Click on a highlighted square to move the unit.  A menu will then display possible options for unit (Wait, Attack).  Click on an option to select it.  Once a unit has been used, it becomes inactive and slightly changes color.
